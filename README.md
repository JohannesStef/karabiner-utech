===============

This lets you use the uTechSmart Venus with a Mac.

The uTechSmart Venus MMO Gaming mouse does not have Mac drivers or configuration software. The operating system recognizes the device simultaneously as a keyboard and a mouse, so its number pad ends up typing numbers and symbols like one.

Using BetterTouchTool to map these buttons leads to the number rows on your other keyboards being mapped to these actions as well.

Use Karabiner first.

This private.xml file for Karabiner will act _specifically_ with a uTechSmart Venus, and leave your keyboards safe.
